            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The experience of all Ages witneſſes this, the Hiſtories of all people abundantly prove it. This preſent Age of ours is a moſt cleere Teſtimonie to aſſert the ſame: Oh all you that paſſe by, was ever griefe and diſtraction

               <!-- PDF PAGE 100 -->like ours? Which to prove, I meane not to runne the Story of all our Evils, nor of that Good wherewith we are ſomewhat recreated and relieved; but onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count one moſt eminent Good, and one Evill diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trally oppoſed to that Good; our great and eminent Good is this: That divine <hi>Mercy</hi> ha's illuminated theſe Kingdomes with the beames of Sacred <hi>Truth,</hi> and the knowledge of the true (that is) of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> for all others beſides it are moſt certainly falſe: Our Exceeding great Evill to that Good oppos'd, is, That either humane ignorance, or perverſeneſſe ha's not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mask't, but dangerouſly clouded the beauty of that Truth with Errors, and torne us into various parts, nay parcels of parts, quite contrary to the nature, ſpirit and <hi>Genius</hi> of Chriſtian <hi>Religion,</hi> which is moſt entirely one, the Author of which is one; and the Prince of peace, the Doctrine, the Goſpell of peace, the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors call'd the Sonnes of peace; and to ſay all in a word, The foundation of which is that great Pacification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt GOD and man; and the end of it eternall peace and tranquillitie. Is it not then ſtrange, that of this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> ſuch and ſo many Diſſentions ſhould be borne? <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe tels us no.<note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> I came not to ſend peace into the Earth; but a ſword, &amp;c. And the enemies of a man ſhall be thoſe of his owne houſe; which words doe not ſhew the end of Chriſts comming, but an event like to ariſe from thence by the averſneſſe of ſome or the moſt of men from his Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Religion</hi> ſprung that hate of the <hi>Jewes</hi> towards the <hi>Samaritans</hi> whoſe ſervice hee would not uſe even in buſineſſe that concerned his life, nor the <hi>Samaritan</hi> his: hence the <hi>Samaritan</hi> woman admires that Jeſus ſhould

               <!-- PDF PAGE 100 -->aske water of her to drinke, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. From ſuch hate and diſſent of minds, Schiſmes, Factions, Seceſſions into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parties ariſe. For as Love is an Affection of Union, ſo hate of diſſeparation. Hence <hi>Synagogues,</hi> are oppoſ'd to Synagogues, Temples to Temples, Altars rais'd againſt Altars, conſecrated and frequented, which neither part wiladmit of Commerce with the other. This is the cauſe, that voyces not unlike thoſe of the <hi>Jſraelites</hi> ſcattering themſelves into Factions, are heard amongſt us now; To thy Tents (O Iſrael!) they have no ſhare in God, nor in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt. For both Factions equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to themſelves that glorious name of the true Iſrael, and take it from the other; as if this were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with plenary abſolute power of judging above the other; or as if the GOD of Heaven had prejudg'd that great name to this partie alone, which hee graciouſly beſtowes upon, and publiſhes to his whole Church: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet do's this im bitterdneſſe of diſſenting minds reſt and fixe it ſelfe in Schiſme; but if peradventure one partie find it ſelfe too ſtrong for the other, it do's not feare to begin a perſecution againſt the adverſe, and to contrive, and labour the utter deſtruction of it, paſſing by no Engine fit for that purpoſe which either wit can invent, or Religious choller can dictat, or the very Shop of Hell can furniſh them withall. They are mad, and commit outrages upon the ſame; the goods and bodies of men alive, upon their duſt, Sepulchers, and memory when they are dead, nay upon the ſoules of living and dead men, and that with all kinds of armes; with mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Calumnies, and Execrations, Excommunications, Anathematiſmes, Libels, Priſons, Baniſhments into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and barbarous Ilands, from their deare Wives and

               <!-- PDF PAGE 101 -->Children, till the adverſe part be either quite extinct, or ſubmit it ſelfe to the will of the prevailing ſide, by abjuring their owne opinion, and receiving that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they lately blam'd, and proteſted againſt.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Gentiles</hi> perſecuted the firſt and beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; thus the <hi>Arians</hi> the Orthodox Divines. If we looke upon our preſent ſtate here at home, I need not caſt about for more Arguments to prove this; all this Towne, all this Kingdome confeſſes, That from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion our greateſt good, diſſentions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate vexations of one another have flow'd, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Religion it ſelfe, but our vice, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or both. And now I come to the Remedy of theſe miſeries and evils, and moſt hopefull appearing way to repoſſeſſe us in that good which wee our ſelves have forfeited. Phyſitians ſay the nature of Remedies is ſuch that they are never applied in vaine; that they either doe good, and truely are what they are ſaid to be, or a great deale of harme: which very thing perſwades me, firſt to remove certaine perverſe remedies in this caſe of controverted Religion, deviſed by men, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed.<note place="margin">2. Ill. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt of all the ſufficiency of implicite faith, by which wee believe without knowledge of the thing it ſelfe, what the Church and Prelats believe, is obtruded upon us as a ſpeciall Remedy, when Religion is diſtemper'd and ſick. With this kind of faith, (ſayes the jeſuite) the Catholique Collier perplext and confuted the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell. And indeed this is a way without doubt not onely to remove diſſentions in Religion, but take away even Religion it ſelfe which cannot be without knowledge and faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 101 -->
2. another Device not unlike this, to ſettle Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is a ſtrange Poſition, yet received in the world; namely, That every man may be ſav'd in his owne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: But this Aſſertion is a Remedie worſe then the Diſeaſe of Religion, and leads thoſe which are poſſeſs'd with that Error to certaine deſtruction; becauſe that opinion makes Error incurable, ſince no man upon this ground, That his owne Religion will ſave him, needs to lay downe or correct his error. <hi>Mahomet</hi> devis'd this to eſtabliſh his <hi>Alcoran</hi> and exempt it from Diſcepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This prevaild in Paganiſme, as appeares by that inſcription of an Altar at <hi>Athens; To the Gods of</hi> Aſia, <hi>to the Gods of</hi> Europe, <hi>and</hi> Affrica, <hi>to unknowne and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Gods.</hi> By this way the Devill ſought to eſtabliſh himſelfe, providing that his Kingdome ſhould not be divided againſt it ſelfe to periſh.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third perverſe Remedie is prohibition of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about Religion, which layes a foundation for moſt ſtupid ignorance. and this is dangerous, whether that Religion which prevailes amongſt a people be true or falſe: if true, by reaſon of the inconſtancie of mans minde ready to be Apoſtate from true Religion, there needs diſpute to confirme it: if falſe, leſt receiv'd Error ſhould be turn'd over, and conſecrated to perpetuity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Romaniſts preſcribe us three Remedies more. They ſend us to the Catholiqne Church, that is, the repreſentative body of the Roman Church, the Biſhop of Rome, the Cardinalls, inferior Biſhops, and other Praelaticall men ſubject to the Pope: and becauſe they believe that all the ſubordinate Biſhops, Cardinalls and Prelates gather'd together may erre, they exempt the Pope from a poſſibility of erring, and turne us over to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156412:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 102 -->his Holineſſe for definitive Sentence, and peremtory Decree, in the Doubts, Controverſies, and Differences in Religion. But this Remedy for two Reaſons is vaine. Firſt, becauſe the Chriſtian world cannot bee convinc'd of the Truth of that Article of Infallibility in the <hi>Pope.</hi> Secondly, when they goe about to prove his Holineſſe infallible by the Scriptures, they teach us unawares to run to the Scripture as the great Preſident, and moſt certaine Determiner in Religion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If this way of cure doe not pleaſe us, they give us a receipt of all the Greeke and Latine Fathers; they bid us ſwallow and digeſt them, and then pick out our Religion from their conſent and agreement: But this Remedie is hopeleſſe for many Reaſons, but eſpecially for that which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> with us agree upon; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That every Father might Erre, and be quite out as well as we.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For further Remedy, They ſend us to conſult with the Decrees of antecedent Councels, and if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie be there once decided, they adviſe us not to call it againe into queſtion. But what if a good Cauſe be ill pleaded and caſt; not for any fault in it ſelfe, but in the aſſertors ſilence for feare or unskilfulneſſe in the Patronage of his cauſe? muſt we then take the Reſult of his weakneſſe for truth upon the word of a Councell?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Some have thought it a hopefull Remedie in caſe of divided Religion, To ſupplicate God Almighty that he would be pleas'd to ſend ſome man from the dead, that of him we might know how God judges of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of diſſenting men. But our Saviour takes us off from this, <hi>Luk</hi> 16. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, whom if they will not heare, neither will they believe though one ſhould riſe from the dead.</hi>

8. There remaines another horrible kind of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and yet ſometimes uſed; namely, the adjuration of damned Spirits in the bodies of the poſſeſs'd men by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſmes and Conjurations to make them anſwere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth of controverted opinions. And this is ſo execrable that I need ſay nothing againſt it. Wee know that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> would not take the Teſtimony of ſuch ſpirits concerning him, but commanded them to hold their peace. But I diſmiſſe theſe wilde Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and come to thoſe which are voted ſober, holy and true, by the moſt learned Writers of the beſt reformed Churches: which Remedies may be diſtributed into Rernedies preparatorie, and Remedies Aphaereticall, or powerfull to take away Diſſentions of minds in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. To the Remedies preparatorie chiefly belong Prayers and ſupplications to God for the knowledge of truth, and the impetration of Chriſtian peace; which prayers joyn'd with faſting and humiliation in duſt and aſhes cannot but be efficacious, becauſe (according to Gods owne command) we pray for the peace of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> To our prayers let a ſerious Correction of our lives be added, or elſe our Prayers are nothing but a fruitleſſe noyſe. Hee that do's the will of my father ſhall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 7. Let thoſe cauſes which beget and nurſe diſſention be taken away: let humility out our pride; let benevolence take place of envy, longanimitie of anger; let a ſober kind of wiſedome in nice queſtions ſet a bound and meaſure to our deſire of knowing ſomthing more then others; let hate and bitterneſſe be laid downe, and in ſtead of them let the bowels of compaſſion bee put on towards thoſe which diſſent from us in Religion and ſeem to be in the error; which wee may eaſily doe if we conſider theſe foure things. 1. How difficult a thing it is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover truth, and decline error. 2. That thoſe who

               <!-- PDF PAGE 103 -->croſſe our opinion, doe it rather out of ignorance then a ſtudied malice to procure eternall deſtruction for their owne ſelves and others. 3. That thoſe whom wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend to bee in ſuch an error may poſſibly bee of the number of Gods elect, and permitted to fall into that error, that God may raiſe them with more glory: and can we then determine any thing rigorouſly againſt our brethren the members of Chriſt, and not onely the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but the ſonnes of God, and the elect heyres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Thus much of preparatory Remedies diſpoſing us to the diſcovery of truth, and the reconciliation of divided parts in Religion. The piety and wiſedome of our Soveraigne Lord, and of this great and honourable Councell ha's already ſhewed us the moſt hopefull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie of our diſtempers, namely a <hi>Synod.</hi> The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which (though it might be heere not unartifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as alſo that authoritie by which a <hi>Synod</hi> ought to be call'd, I willingly omit. A young Divine may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trip in a politicall diſcourſe: but I have reſolved with my ſelfe not to touch on any thing which is not ſafe for me, nor to ſay any thing which a wiſe man perhaps will not venture to ſay after me. But will you now heare the judgement of grave, honeſt, and learned Divines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the qualifications and accompliſhments of ſuch as are fit to be <hi>Synoders?</hi> Such men (ſay they) ought to be convein'd as are inſtructed with wiſedome, ſanctity of life, and experience of things, ſuch as burne with the zeale of God, and the ſalvation of men, with the love of truth, and Chriſtian peace; ſuch as are acknowledg'd by probable reaſons to have the Spirit of Truth, by which they are enabled to diſcerne betwixt true and falſe, good and bad; and ſince Laicks as well as Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick men may be endowed with ſuch abilities; <hi>Laicks</hi> (ſay the ſame <hi>Authors</hi>) whether they be inplace of <hi>office</hi> and Dignitie, nor more private may be admitted to the
<pb facs="tcp:156412:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 103 -->ſacred <hi>Convent:</hi> the dore of the <hi>houſe</hi> where ſuch'a <hi>Convent</hi> is held, they would have thus inſcrib'd with golden let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Let no man enter here, but he that is ſtudious of Truth and peace: may God himſelfe place his Angel with a flaming ſword at the entrance of this Paradiſe where divine Truth and the lovely Concord of the Church is conſulted about, to keepe back all thoſe who are otherwiſe minded.</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>In ſuch a <hi>Synod</hi> Divines agree, That the <hi>Prerogatives</hi> of Princes, making of war, with other Politicall chings, are not to be handled; but things pertaining purely to Religion, ſuch as are (ſay they) the Doctrine of Faith and manners, <hi>&amp; Ordo Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> the interpretation of which words I permit to every man, becauſe I mean to be offenſive to none, except it be for not rendring them. <hi>In dogmatis,</hi> or in opinions two things are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd; 1. the truth of them; 2. how great the neceſſitie is of knowing, beleeving and doing according to them. The end of ſuch a ſacred Convent ſhould be the illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Truth, the conſervation and propagation of it, extirpation of errors the peace of the Church, whence exiſts the glory of God, and the eternall ſalvation of man. Now whether a preſidence in ſuch a <hi>Synod</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible to any one particular man, or whether to avoid confuſion, ſeverall Preſidents to ſucceed one another may not be needfull, I leave to the reſolution of honeſt and wiſe men. But I think ſome kind of Preſident might be very uſefull to propoſe thines to be done, to aske o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, to collect them by the ſervice of Notaries, and governe the whole action.</p>
            <p>Actions which paſſe in ſuch a <hi>Synod</hi> by Divines are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to three; 1. acurate diſceptation about controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; 2. mature conſultation; 3. A free ſpeaking of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones ſentence concerning what is enquir'd, the rule of all which is the Word of God contain'd in the old and new Teſtament. All men which write upon this
<pb facs="tcp:156412:7"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 104 -->ſubject agree, that Diſputations in <hi>Synods</hi> ought not to be made in Rhetoricall flouriſhes, but in Logicall conciſe argumentations, in which all extemporality and praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitant haſt muſt be taken heed of. They adviſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants on both ſides to take time enough for juſt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, &amp; for the avoiding of many abſurdities, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe in writing the ſumm of what they intend to ſpeak, and thence to recite it. The Diſputation being ended, grave and mature deliberation is to be uſed both about the Controverſies themſelves and Arguments urg'd by both ſides, that by contracting the whole Diſpute to a narrow compaſs, the truth at one intuition may appeare and be receiv'd with the content and aſtipulation of the whole body. And becauſe nothing ha's more hindred the diſcovery of <hi>Truth,</hi> &amp; agreement of men in <hi>Religion,</hi> then that ſome men who have tyed themſelves to opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at home, bring them to the <hi>Synod,</hi> and reſolve to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them there: therfore it is neceſſary (ſayes my Author) that <hi>ſanctum juramentum</hi> a holy Oath ſhould be given to every man convented to ſpeak all in the feare of <hi>God</hi> from a good <hi>conſcience,</hi> to maintain nothing which he thinks falſe, to conceal nothing which he thinks true though it make againſt himſelfe, not to urge any thing which is doubtfull for a thing certaine, but that he will be ready to doe all which lies in him that may conduce to the diſcovery of <hi>Truth,</hi> and promotion of <hi>Chriſtian peace.</hi> From minds of men diſpos'd as aforeſaid to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and agreement, from a <hi>Synod</hi> thus adminiſtred and regulated, we may expect by Gods mercy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, a glorious riſing and breaking forth of Truth and peace upon us, and have cauſe to receive them with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions Jubiles, and ſuch like acclamations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Truth and righteouſnes look downe from heaven upon us, and we ſee Ieruſalem as a Citie at unity within it ſelfe. Pray for them that love her: peace be upon them, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi>
